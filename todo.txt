* restore previous selection contents (both PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD)
* get rid of pasting delay if possible (presumably application quits earlier
  than pasting from PRIMARY occurs, resulting in PRIMARY clearing. Pasting from
  CLIPBOARD works ok)
* show UI close to text input field, not cursor (if possible)
